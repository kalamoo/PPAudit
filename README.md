This is the repository for VPVet, a system that automatically vet privacy policy compliance issues in the VR ecosystem. Please refer to our paper ''VPVet: Vetting Privacy Policies of Virtual Reality Apps'' for more information.

## VRPP Dataset Collection
We use WebScraper to crawl meta-info (e.g., app name, genres, description, etc.) of VR apps from different VR platforms, then we further use Selenium to crawl the privacy policies of VR apps.
